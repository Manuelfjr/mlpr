<img src="assets/regression_plots.png" alt="Regression Plots" href="assets/regression_plots.png">

This repository is a developing library named `MLPR` (Machine Learning Pipeline Report). It aims to facilitate the creation of machine learning models in various areas such as regression, forecasting, classification, and clustering. The library allows the user to perform tuning of these models, generate various types of plots for post-modeling analysis, and calculate various metrics.

In addition, `MLPR` allows the creation of metric reports using [`Jinja2`](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/), including the obtained graphs. The user can customize the report template according to their needs.

# Using the MLPR Library
The MLPR library is a powerful tool for machine learning and data analysis. Here's a brief guide on how to use it.

## Installation
Before you start, make sure you have installed the MLPR library. You can do this by running pip install mlpr.


```bash
pip install mlpr
```

# Regression
