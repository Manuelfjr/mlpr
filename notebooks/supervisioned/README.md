# Examples

The examples path cover various techniques, including:

- **Classification**: Examples of classification algorithms, which are used to predict the class or category of an instance or example. Furthermore, thet modulo for classification have support for metrics calculation and metrics creation for evaluation.

- **Regression**: Examples of regression algorithms, which are used to predict a continuous value.

- **Surrogates**: Examples of surrogate modeling, which is a technique used to substitute a complex or computationally expensive model with a simpler one.

- **Forecasting**: Forecasting examples will be added in the future. Forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on historical data.

- **Tuning**: Examples of model tuning, which is a process that involves training multiple models on a grid of hyperparameters and selecting the best model based on a chosen or user-created metric. This process helps to optimize the performance of the model and can lead to more accurate predictions.
